# Intro

17 years of web development experience have given me opportunities to participate in different types of projects - for small and large business, for commercial and non-profit organizations, for e-commerce and healthcare industry.

Over the first 15 years of my career I've focused primarily on e-commerce/retail domains and was strongly involved in the Oracle Web Commerce (formerly ATG) and Oracle xStore POS based enterprises. Have participated in designing, developing, rolling out large e-commerce solutions for different types of clients from various locations (USA, France, UK, Czech Republic, Russia, Germany).

Staring from 2018 my key domain has become 'payments'. Iâ€™m an expert in various gateway integrations, API and platforms, able to demonstrate in depth knowledge in this area, able to build/design complex technical solutions, be responsible for business architecture and e2e payment flows.
