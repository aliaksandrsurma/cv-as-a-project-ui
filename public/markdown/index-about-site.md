# Idea

As an engineer / architect I used to conduct many technical interviews and I was always surprised how many candidates were not able to present their experience in structured and efficient way. For solution architects there was also an NDA aspect, so they couldn't easily share or present artifacts they had created. White-boarding partially solved this problem, but it's still problematic to present and elaborate on a complex enterprise solution in a short time.

So, one day I asked myself - how would I do things if I were an **interviewee**, how could I convert my CV 'as-a-file' into something more 'fun' and interesting to use, read and evaluate. Something that may (al least partially) help to prove my experience and hands on architecture/engineering skills.

This is how idea of 'CV as a project' has been born...
_( + CV ASAP is also kind of a nice acronym too, isn't it? :)_

# Build

I've ended up with managing it as a small project with 'backlog' items that I created for myself.\
Example:\

# Result

Outcome is my personal domain hosting my CV plus additional portals  -  set of **simplified** artifacts that also represent myself as an engineer.
